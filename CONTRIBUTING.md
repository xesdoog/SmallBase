# Introduction

SmallBase is a lightweight Lua framework designed to provide developers with the tools and foundations to create their own scripts, without imposing specific features.

With that out of the way, thank you for considering contributing to this small project. It's people like you that make these open source projects great!

## Commit Convention

These are recommended, but not enforced yet. SmallBase follows similar commit guidelines to [YimMenu](https://github.com/Mr-X-GTA/YimMenu/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md):

### Commit Structure

  ```text
  <type>(scope): <description>

  [optional body]

  [optional footer]
  ```

- **Types (lowercase only):**
  - feat: New features.
  - fix: Bug fixes.
  - style: Feature and updates related to styling.
  - refactor: Refactoring a specific section of the codebase.
  - test: Everything related to testing.
  - docs: Everything related to documentation.
  - chore: Regular code maintenance.

- **Scope:**
  - A scope is a phrase describing parts of the code affected by the changes. For example `(translations)`.

- **Body (Optional):**
  - The commit body can provide additional contextual information. For breaking changes, the body MUST start with "BREAKING CHANGE".

- **Footer (Optional):**
  - A commit footer is used to reference issues affected by the code changes. For example: "Fixes #13". It can also be used to indicate breaking changes by starting with "BREAKING CHANGE".

- **Example:**

  ```text
  fix(SomeFeature): fix constructor returning an empty object.
  docs(Readme): document coding conventions
  ```

## Coding Standards

### Annotations

Annotate all enums, classes, and class methods using [LuaLS](https://luals.github.io/wiki/annotations/)'s style.

Annotations are critical for readability, code completion, error checking, and automatic generation of class documentations.

For comments/summaries/descriptions, you can use as many dashes as you want but please leave a space between the last dash and the text.

- **Example:**

    ```lua
    -- Calculates the sum of two numbers.
    ---@param a number The first number
    ---@param b number The second number
    ---@return number The sum of both numbers
    function MyClass:Add(a, b)
        return a + b
    end
    ```

### Global Variables

There are two ways to declare globals:

1. Globals that should be serialized to JSON:
Index SmallBase's `GVars` table. Even if the variable was never declared before:

    ```lua
    GVars.some_feature_enabled, _ = ImGui.Checkbox("My Checkbox", GVars.some_feature_enabled)
    ```

2. Regular globals:
Use Lua's default global table `_G`:

    ```lua
    some_global_number = 123
    ```

### Style

You are free to use any style you want, except in these cases:

| Scope | Naming | Example |
| ----------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| Global Functions | PascalCase | `function DoSomething(...) end` |
| Local Functions | any (consistent) | You are free to use any style as long as it stays consistent throughout the whole file |
| Standard Lib Extensions | Use the lib's default style | `string.somefunc = function(...) end` |
| Enums | PascalCase prefixed with a lowercase `e` | `eExampleEnum` |
| Enum Members | Preferably UPPER_SNAKE_CASE but PascalCase is also allowed | `eExampleEnum.SOME_MEMBER`/`eExampleEnum.SomeMember` |
| Classes | PascalCase | `MyNewClass = Class("MyNewClass")` |
| Class Methods | PascalCase | `function MyNewClass:ExampleMethod(...) end` |
| Class Private Variables | snake_case prefixed with an `m` | `m_handle` |

### Formatting

- **Indentations:**
  - Does not matter. If using tabs, make sure one tab equals **four** spaces.

- **Line Wrapping:**
  - Try to wrap wide lines using either your IDE's formatter or a Pythonic way.

    - Example:

        ```lua
        SomeFunc(param1, param2, param3, param4, param5, param6, param7, param8, param9, ...)
        ```

    - Preferred (Pythonic) style:

        ```lua
        SomeFunc(
            param1,
            param2,
            param3,
            param4,
            param5,
            param6,
            param7,
            param8,
            param9,
            ...
        )
        ```

- **Nested `if` Statements:**

  - Always try to use guarded if statements when applicable.

    - Example:

        ```lua
        local cond_1 = false
        local cond_2 = nil
        local cond_3 = true

        if cond_1 then
            if cond_2 then
                if cond_3 then
                    DoSomething()
                end
            end
        end
        ```

    - Preferred approach:

        ```lua
        local cond_1 = false
        local cond_2 = nil
        local cond_3 = true

        if not cond_1 then
            return
        end

        if not cond_2 then
            return
        end

        if not cond_3 then
            return
        end

        DoSomething()
        ```

    - Shorter version:

        ```lua
        local cond_1 = false
        local cond_2 = nil
        local cond_3 = true

        if not (cond_1 and cond_2 and cond_3) then
            return
        end

        DoSomething()
        ```

## Translations

- The primary language for all labels is English (US) (`/lib/translations/en-US.lua`).
- To add a new language, add its name and ISO code to `/lib/translations/locales.lua`.
- To add a new label, update `/lib/translations/en-US.lua`.
- All other language files will be automatically generated via GitHub Actions (you can also manually run `/scripts/generate_translations.py`).

**Example usage:**
Suppose you want to draw some text that gets automatically translated:

1. Open `/lib/translations/en-US.lua`.
2. Add a key-value pair for your new label:

    ```lua
    return {
      ...
      ["MY_LABEL"] = "My label's text in English."
    }
    ```

3. Use the `key` with the `_T` wrapper for the [`Translator:Translate(...)`](docs/services/Translator.md) method:

    ```lua
    ImGui.Text(_T("MY_LABEL"))
    ```

## What To Avoid

- Manually editing any language file except `en-US.lua`. They are auto-generated.

- Adding end-user features directly to the project *(ex: A drift minigame, a business manager, animations, etc.)*.
