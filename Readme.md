# SmallBase

A lightweight Lua base designed to simplify interaction with the game world. Ideal for building roleplay mechanics, experience-enhancing features, or sandbox tools under YimMenu's Lua API. Cross-compatibility with YimMenu V2 may be implemented in the future.

This project is a tribute to pocakking's BigBase: The biological father of YimMenu.
